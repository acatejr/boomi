Undeploying is when you remove a packaged component from the list of active deployments.

## Reasons to Undeploy:
* Processes no longer needed - When you have a process that no longer needs to run a deployed environment, you can undeploy it
* Regain licenses - when you undeploy a process, you will regain the connection licenses
* After undeploying, the process still exists as a packaged component
