Process Reporting is useful because it allows you to search for information about process executions and the documents associated with them.

* Manually execute a process - manually execute an integration process from Process Reporting by selecting an Atom and the process
* Filters process executions - process Manager filters executions by type, atom, time, and status
* Process reporting page:
    * Execute button - let's you manually execute a deployed process
    * Auto refresh - if on, will refresh every minute
