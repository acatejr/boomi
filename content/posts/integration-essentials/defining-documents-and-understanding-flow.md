## Documents
* A document is a set of data that flows through the Boomi process.  It can be a single record, a group of records, or and entire file.
* Boomi supports the following document types:
    * XML
    * Json
    * Flat File
    * Database
* You can only use these documents or profile types in Atmosphere.
* Source files and destination files must be one of these types
* Documents flow together as group, but each shape processes them individually
